# Test Shopping Cart App
- Created using Angular's base ng serve setup.
- There are the given baskets, with a calculate button to return the proper tax/cost.
- Run using ng serve after cloning in (assuming npm/angular is setup).


Bonus:
- You can make your own list with the three input windows. The first one is amount, second one is the name of the item, and last is cost of the item.
- Hit add to add this to temporarily, and hit calculate to calculate total cost of the list. Hit refresh to create a new list.


Todo:
- Would be very straightforward to add a delete function to remove items from a list.
- Store lists for usage later, if needed. Currently deletes on refresh.
